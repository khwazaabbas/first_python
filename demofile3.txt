Whispers of the Earth

The golden sun begins to rise,
Painting fire across the skies.
A gentle breeze, so light, so free,
Dances softly through the trees.

The river hums a quiet tune,
Reflecting light from silver moon.
Mountains stand so bold, so high,
Guardians of the endless sky.

The flowers bloom in colors bright,
A masterpiece of pure delight.
The birds compose their morning song,
A melody both sweet and strong.

The ocean roars, the forests sigh,
A living world beneath the sky.
Nature speaks in voice so true,
A whispered song for me and you.
